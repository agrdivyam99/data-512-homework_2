# Data Collection and Analysis

## Objective

This project aims to collect, process, and analyze data from multiple sources to extract meaningful insights. The data collection phase utilizes APIs and custom scripts, while the analysis phase applies various statistical and visualization techniques. The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights based on trends and patterns observed in the collected data.

## Source Data Licensing

The datasets utilized in this project are collected through publicly available APIs or databases. They are subject to their respective licensing agreements, which are listed below for each data source. The data collection process adheres to privacy and usage guidelines set forth by the providers.

- **[API/Data Source Name]**: [License link or description]

Please review the terms of use and licensing agreements for any restrictions on how the data can be used.

## API Reference

For data collection, this project utilizes the following APIs and data sources:

- **API 1**: [Link to API documentation]
- **API 2**: [Link to API documentation]

Each API is queried based on a specific data range and parameters. Ensure you have access to valid API keys, where applicable, before running the notebook.

## Data Files Produced

The data collection scripts in this notebook generate the following output files:

1. **[file_name_1]**  
   - Description: This file contains [explain data content and format].
   - Format: JSON/CSV/etc.
  
2. **[file_name_2]**  
   - Description: This file provides [explain data content and format].
   - Format: JSON/CSV/etc.

## Data Structure

The output data follows this structure:

- **field_1**: Description of the field (e.g., unique identifier, date, value)
- **field_2**: Description of the field (e.g., metric, type, etc.)
- **field_3**: Description of the field (e.g., category, classification, etc.)

## How to Run the Notebook

1. **Install dependencies**  
   Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Run the following command to install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **API Keys and Authentication**  
   If the notebook requires access to APIs, ensure you have the correct API keys and credentials. Update the necessary variables in the notebook to include your keys.

3. **Run the Notebook**  
   Open the notebook and run each cell sequentially. It will automatically collect data, process it, and generate the outputs as specified in the data files section.

## Known Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: Some APIs impose rate limits. If the limit is reached, you may encounter delays or incomplete data collection. Implementing a sleep period between API requests can help alleviate this issue.
  
- **Incomplete Data**: Some datasets may have missing records for certain periods. This is due to data unavailability or delays in the source system.

## Data Analysis

The analysis performed in this notebook covers the following:

- **[Type of Analysis 1]**: Describe the analysis and its purpose (e.g., correlation analysis, time series trends).
- **[Type of Analysis 2]**: Provide details on another type of analysis (e.g., visualization, forecasting).
  
Plots and charts generated during the analysis are saved to the `./plots/` directory.

## Licensing and Credits
